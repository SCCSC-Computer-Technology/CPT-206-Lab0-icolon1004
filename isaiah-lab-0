## I learned how to create a clone and branch from the main file. The branch is a copy of the main file so you can work on it without messing with the main file.
The main file is set and should not be mainly worked on until everything from the branch has passed and is working.
Once the code is finished in a branch, you can submit a pull request where the team or whoever is in charge can then test the code to see if it works.
After the code has passed inspection, the code can then be pushed to the main file, overwriting it and applying the changes.
A fork is a copy of a repository, like a branch. I do not understand the difference between the two other than it says that a fork is mainly used to work on someone else's code.
The clone, branch, and fork are all very similar, my understanding is that the clone is just a copy of the file to do whatever, a branch is a copy of the main file to work on and improve, and a fork
is a copy of someone else's code to experiment with. I do not understand how any of these are any different other than being used for specific things.
